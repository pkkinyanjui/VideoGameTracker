## Overview

### Description

Our App can be generalized as a tracker for people's video game journey. It has three primary functions so far. These include, a discover page to find new games to play, a wishlist to track games you want to play, and a saved games page to track games you have previously played. The discover page will display a new game and brief details. With a click, the user can see a more descriptive break down of the game and even add the game to their wishlist. The wishlist will games added and their details when clicked. The saved games list will have previously played games. Users can leave notes about the game and even leave a review for the game.
